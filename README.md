Project Summary
This project introduces the design of a machine learning algorithm aimed at predicting stock market crashes based on historical price information. Publicly available market data from seven major stock market indices were used for this purpose. The goal is to forecast whether a crash will occur within the next 1, 3, or 6 months at any given point in time. The project involves the use of linear and logistic regression models, support vector machines, decision trees, and recurrent neural networks with long short term memory (RNN LSTM).

Repository Organization

exploration.ipynb: This notebook contains data exploration, crash definition, and identification for all seven datasets.

results.ipynb: This notebook provides a summary of the results for training, validation, and testing of all the models used in the project.

data: This folder contains .csv files of the daily price information for all datasets used. This data is publicly available on Yahoo Finance.

Please note that due to the ongoing nature of this project, certain elements such as detailed model notebooks, a final predictor, and specific crash prediction examples are not included at this time. As the project progresses, these elements will be added to the repository.

This project is a work in progress and the current state of the repository reflects the work done up to this point. Future updates will include more detailed analysis, model training, and testing, as well as the implementation of a final predictor.
