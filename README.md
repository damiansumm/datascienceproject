Project Summary
This project introduces the design of a machine learning algorithm, logistic regression, to predict stock market crashes based on historical price information. Publicly available market data from Dow Inc. (DOW) was used for this purpose. The goal is to forecast whether a crash will occur within the next 1, 3, or 6 months at any given point in time.
